FILE TO EXPLAIN WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE K MEANS CLUSTERING
PROGRAM (IT'S A BIT OF A MESS)

PREPROCESSING:

1. READ FILE INTO DATAFRAME
2. ENCODE DIRECTIONAL DATA:
    a. assign each compass direction a degree value
    b. store the sine and cosine of each degree value to demonstrate
       circular nature of the data
    c. drop degree and compass columns.
3. ENCODE YES/NO COLUMNS IN BINARY
4. ENCODE DATE DATA
    a. split into DoY and year columns
    b. subtract year from a set baseline year (doesn't make a difference,
       as far as I can tell, but it looks nicer)
5. ENCODE LOCATION DATA:
    numeric encoding of each location
6. HANDLE MISSING VALUES
    a. on testing, a good threshold percent for missing data seemed
       to be about 15%
    b. if missing > 15%, drop the whole column
    c. else, fill NaN with mean of the column
7. STANDARDIZATION
